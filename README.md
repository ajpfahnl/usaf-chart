# USAF Chart Utilities

Thus repo contains utilities and sample workflows for USAF chart creation and analysis:
 * __Generate USAF-style charts__: [CreateUSAF](CreateUSAF.py) is a python class that creates numpy arrays representing black and white images of custom USAF-style charts. An example workflow can be found in [this](create.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook.
 * __MTF__: A sample crude MTF chart from a USAF chart can be found in [this](mtf.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook.
